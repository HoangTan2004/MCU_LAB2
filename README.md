## Introduction
- **Course:** Microprocessor - Microcontroller (CO3009)
- **Content:** Timer Interrupt and LED Scanning

## Description for other branch
All other branches are exercises for Lab 2, including:

1. `STM32` folder: Source code on STM32F103C6.
2. `Proteus` folder: Schematic file (**.pdsprj**), is used to simulate the system on Proteus (using STM32F103C6).
### exercise1
Display number **1** on the first LED and number **2** on the second LED with the switching time between two LEDs is half of second.
### exercise2
Display four 7-segment LEDs with the switching time is half of second and blinking two LEDs every second independently.
### exercise3
Display four 7-segment LEDs with an array of 4 integer numbers `led_buffer[4]`
### exercise4
Set the frequency of four 7-segment LEDs to 1Hz
### exercise5
Generate values for the array `led_buffer` with the function `updateClockBuffer`
### exercise6
Add `TIME_CYCLE` for the software timer
### exercise9
Display the character **A** on the LED matrix
### exercise10
Shift left the character on the LED matrix
