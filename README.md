## Introduction
- **Course:** Microprocessor - Microcontroller (CO3009)
- **Content:** Timer Interrupt and LED Scanning

## Description for other branch
All other branches are exercises for Lab 2, including:

1. `STM32` folder: Source code on STM32F103C6.
2. `Proteus` folder: Schematic file (**.pdsprj**), is used to simulate the system on Proteus (using STM32F103C6).
### exercise1
Display number **1** on the first LED and number **2** on the second LED with the switching time between two LEDs is half of second.
### exercise2
Display four 7-segment LEDs with the switching time is half of second and blinking two LEDs every second independently.
